  Use Windows line break (CRLF), not Unix (LF).
  Use .gitattributes file to make sure this.

Style Guide:
  Use PascalCase, although the language is case insensitive.

If you don't know the syntax:
  Follow into each #Include file, read every single comments in them. You'll become a master when finish.
  Make sure to read the files in order from top to bottom, don't jump around.
