  ::what you type::what it'll turn into
  Triggers after an "ending character" is typed, which includes space and enter and punctuations.
  Add O between the first two colons means don't display the ending character
  Add * between the first two colons means fire immediately without waiting for the ending character.
  Add ? between the first two colons means fire even when the HotString is inside another word
  Add X between the first two colons means fire means call a function instead of sending text
  # and ^ and + needs an R as escape char, forgot why.
