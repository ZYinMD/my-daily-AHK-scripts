Purpose:
  Win + z => Ctrl + PgUp

Syntax:
  hotkey::function call.
  Key combination is allowed on the left side which is different from a remap.
  ^ = Ctrl, ! = Alt, + = Shift, # = Win.
  Send is a built-in function. Curly braces means a key. Without curly braces it'll be sent as string input.

  LCtrl + shift + enter => new line above
Why do this:
  To mimic the Sublime Text behavior in other apps, but with LCtrl only, because RCtrl + Enter in other apps needs to be reserved for their own settings.
Syntax:
  In the following case, <^ means LCtrl, >^ means RCtrl.

/*
Purpose:
  Restore the original function of ` key
Explain:
  Since ` has become a modifier key, it no longer works when pressed, because the script is always waiting for the potential second key.
*/
`::` ; Remap ` to itself, the script will know you want a restore, but it only fires on key up.


/*
Purpose:
  Use ; as a modifier to type symbols
Syntax:
  1. Unless appears right after another character, ; needs ` as an escape char.
  2. The Send {keyname} was the traditional syntax, and the bare key name is the new syntax introduced after 2018 version. However, I found it creates a bug where j; / l; / d; etc doesn't output the semicolon if you press too fast. So the old syntax is more reliable.
  3. Also, when using MS PinYin, symbols like ? and ! will trigger the shift key and switch the input to English, the old method doesn't have this issue.
