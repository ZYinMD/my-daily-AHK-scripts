; Important Node: For unknown reasons, UTF-8 is not enough for special characters like ↑↓←→. To fix, open with Notepad, then save as.., choose UTF-8 and overwrite. This will change the encoding from UTF-8 to UTF-8 with BOM. Then it'll work.

/*
Goal:
  Hotstrings and auto-replace
Syntax:
  ::what you type::what it'll turn into
  Triggers after an "ending character" is typed, which includes space and enter and punctuations.
  Add O between the first two colons means don't display the ending character
  Add * between the first two colons means fire immediately without waiting for the ending character.
  Add ? between the first two colons means fire even when the hotstring is inside another word
  # and ^ and + needs an R as escape char, forgot why.
Background Story:
  The hotstrings are inspired by Chinese
